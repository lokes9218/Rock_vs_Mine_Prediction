The "Rock vs. Mine Prediction" project focuses on predicting whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), and logistic regression, this project provides an end-to-end solution for accurate classification.

## Project Overview

The goal of the "Rock vs. Mine Prediction" project is to develop a model that can accurately classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines. This classification task has significant applications in areas such as marine exploration and defense. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and a carefully curated dataset, this project enables accurate predictions for real-world scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Processing:** The project involves collecting a dataset containing features related to underwater objects. Using Pandas, the collected data is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed to ensure it is suitable for analysis. The dataset is included in the repository for easy access.

- **Data Visualization:** The project utilizes data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. By employing Matplotlib or Seaborn, visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices are created. These visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the data and assist in feature selection.

- **Train-Test Split:** To evaluate the performance of the classification model, the project employs the train-test split technique. The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets, ensuring that the model is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data. This allows for an accurate assessment of the model's generalization capabilities.

- **Logistic Regression Model:** The project utilizes logistic regression, a popular supervised learning algorithm, to build the classification model. Logistic regression is well-suited for binary classification tasks and offers interpretability. The Scikit-learn library provides an implementation of logistic regression that is utilized in this project.

- **Model Evaluation:** To assess the performance of the logistic regression model, the project employs various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify rocks and mines. Additionally, techniques like confusion matrices are employed to visualize the model's performance.
